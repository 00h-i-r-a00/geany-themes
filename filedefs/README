Do not edit the '[styling]' section of these filetype.* files directly, 
instead edit the *.conf files under the 'mappings' directory.  Only edit
other sections of these files as desired.

Please don't send any patches with changes to the '[styling]' section of
these files.  Other patches can be considered, but these files, with the 
exception of the '[styling]' section are Geany's default.

All patches against filetypes.common will, however, be considered.  If you
change something in filetypes.common, make sure to update any of the themes
with your changes, where required.

If you've found an problem and don't want to create a patch yourself, please
post an 'Issue' at https://github.com/codebrainz/geany-themes/issues and I 
will take care of it.
