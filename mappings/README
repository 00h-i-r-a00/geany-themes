Edit these *.conf files to determine which lexer state gets mapped to which
named style.  All filetypes.* using the specific lexer will get it's *.conf
file substituted into the '[styling]' section.  This way there is only one
file to maintain for each different Scintilla lexer.  For example, the CPP 
lexer is used by C, C++, Java, Vala, ActionScript, Javascript, and several
other filetypes, and so it only requires changing mappings in the cpp.conf file 
here once.  Most of the mappings are straight-forward, but some lexers that I
don't know or use the language, I guessed at mapping the states.

Please send patches against these files if you've found a problem or think
that a file can have better mapping.

Try to use the numbered named styles where possible, for example, in the
python.conf, the 'string' state is mapped to 'string_1' and the triple-quoted
strings are mapped to 'string_2'.  If a theme designer wanted these to be
different styles, they would just set them appropriately in the colorscheme
.conf file rather than having to edit the mapping/filetypes files.  The goal
is to have one set of mappings and named styles that will work with all
filetypes.

If you've found an problem and don't want to create a patch yourself, please
post an 'Issue' at https://github.com/codebrainz/geany-themes/issues and I 
will take care of it.
