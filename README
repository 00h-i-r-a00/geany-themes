Geany Color Themes
------------------

You need to replace all the old filetypes.* files, so make a backup before hand
if you want.

Put the contents of the filedefs dir (filetypes.* files) into either the
user geany data filedefs dir (ex. ~/.config/geany/filedefs) or in the system
wide geany data dir (ex. /usr/share/geany).

Put the contents of the colorschemes dir (*.conf) into either the user geany
data colorschemes dir (ex. ~/.config/geany/colorschemes) or in the system
wide geany data colorschemes dir (ex. /usr/share/geany/colorschemes).


Please send patches for the filetypes.* files and new colorschemes and I'll
add theme here.
