Geany Color Themes
==================

Note: You need to replace all the old filetypes.* files, so make a backup 
before hand if you want.

General Installation:
---------------------

Put the contents of the filedefs dir (filetypes.* files) into either the
user geany data filedefs dir (ex. ~/.config/geany/filedefs) or in the system
wide geany data dir (ex. /usr/share/geany).

Put the contents of the colorschemes dir (*.conf) into either the user geany
data colorschemes dir (ex. ~/.config/geany/colorschemes) or in the system
wide geany data colorschemes dir (ex. /usr/share/geany/colorschemes).
