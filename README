Geany Themes README - Development/Maintained Branch
===================================================

Please read this, admittedly long-winded, yet very important front-matter which
follows, to save yourself frustration...

*Are you using Geany < 0.20?*
-----------------------------
Unfortunately, this is not supported, sorry.

*Are you using Geany 0.20?*
---------------------------
If so, you can get a compatible version of Geany Themes from either of these
download addresses:
	https://github.com/downloads/codebrainz/geany-themes/geany-themes-0.20.zip
	https://github.com/downloads/codebrainz/geany-themes/geany-themes-0.20.tar.bz2

_Note:_ There are no plans to further update Geany Themes 0.20 releases, but
if you send me an udpated `geany-themes-0.20.x.zip` or
`geany-themes-0.20.x.tar.bz2` file (or both), I will check them out and add
them as updated download links here in the README and in the Github downloads.

*Are you using Geany 0.21?*
---------------------------
If so, you can get a compatible version of Geany Themes from either of these
download addresses:
	https://github.com/downloads/codebrainz/geany-themes/geany-themes-0.21.zip
	https://github.com/downloads/codebrainz/geany-themes/geany-themes-0.21.tar.bz2

_Note:_ There are no plans to further update Geany Themes 0.21 releases, but
if you send me an udpated `geany-themes-0.21.x.zip` or
`geany-themes-0.21.x.tar.bz2` file (or both), I will check them out and add
them as updated download links here in the README and in the Github downloads.

*IMPORTANT: ALL USERS*
----------------------
The color schemes here are only compatible with Geany 1.22 and no other
versions. Check your version of Geany by checking the `About` dialog in the
`Help` menu. Please note that Geany version 1.22 is as of yet (Feb 27/2012)
unreleased and so this is the "development" version of Geany Themes. All bugs
should be reported against this version.

*IMPORTANT: ALL USERS*
----------------------
Each release and even the development branch contains a README* file with
information you should read (yes, that's this file), explaining how to install
and uninstall the themes.

*IMPORTANT: UBUNTU/UNITY USERS*
-------------------------------
There is a conflict in Geany's code when you are using Unity's DBUS menu (that
global menu at the top of the screen). The fix for this is available in the
`master` branch of Geany. To work around the problem before the fix was
applied, you can ensure that the environment variable `UBUNTU_MENUPROXY` is set
to `0` before running Geany. This will disable Unity from stealing Geany's main
menu and will leave it within Geany's main window. You should be able to edit
your launchers for Geany to run like this `UBUNTU_MENUPROXY=0 geany`. You can
even make a Bash alias if you wish.

Unix-like Installation
----------------------

Extract the tarball and copy all of the files in the `colorschemes` directory
to your `~/.config/geany/colorschemes/` directory. Create that directory if it
doesn't already exist.

Windows Installation
--------------------

Extract the tarball and copy all of the files in the `colorschemes` directory
to your `C:\Users\YourUserName\AppData\Roaming\geany\colorschemes` directory.
Create this directory if it doesn't already exist.

_Note:_ The Windows directory paths above are for Windows 7, they might be
different for other Windows versions (see the Geany manual).

_Note:_ Both of the above instructions will want to over-write your existing
colorschemes and filedefs which you might have customized. Be sure to backup
any files in those directories that you do not want over-written.

_Note:_ In this development branch, the `filedefs` have been upstreamed and so
are no longer required as part of this project. This is unlike previous
releases, if you were wondering.

Geany Themes was created and is maintained by Matthew Brush <matt@geany.org>.
